ChemShell notes

[to work on sometime]

Goal:
interactive shell of some format

- balance equations (including redox)
- perform mole conversions
- use as human-like syntax as possible
- all-caps for primary queries
- possibly unit conversions (accept standard abbreviations)
- number storage (???)

>>> GRAMS 12 moles CH4
>>> MOLES 9 grams Hydrogen Peroxide
>>> @ EQUALS GRAMS 12 moles CH4
>>> OUNCES 1 mole carbon

>>> BALANCE H2SO4 + NaOH --> H20 + Na2SO4
>>> BALANCE Cu + HN03 --> Cu(2+) + NO

>>> PREDICT GRAMS H20 BALANCE 25gH2SO4 + 15gNaOH --> H20 + Na2SO4

- Charges go in parentheses (so Cu2(+) and Cu(2+) aren't the same
- Each primary query has some syntax
- Need to parse nomenclatureâ€¦ could be tricky
- Assemble giant chart of ions to formulae and charges (hypo,ite,ate,per)
- Make everything work well together
- Quick-reference

Make it so you can put in KILOGRAMS [something]

Dev plans:
1. Convert mass to moles in elements
2. Convert mass to moles in compounds (read chem formulas)
3. Read names into formulas with polyatomic ions, etc.
4. Other unit conversions
5. Predict, given balanced equations
6. How many moles X to react with Y? once you balance equation
